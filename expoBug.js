This error typically arises when you're working with Expo's managed workflow and encounter issues related to native modules or platform-specific code.  The core problem is that Expo's managed workflow simplifies development by abstracting away the complexities of native Android and iOS development.  However, when you try to integrate a native module that Expo doesn't fully support or hasn't properly configured, these errors occur. For instance, the error might manifest during the build process or when you try to run the app on a device or emulator.  The lack of specific details in the error message makes it challenging to pinpoint the exact cause, often requiring careful investigation.
