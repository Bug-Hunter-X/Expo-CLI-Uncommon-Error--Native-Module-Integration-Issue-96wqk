# Expo CLI Uncommon Error: Native Module Integration Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using the Expo CLI, specifically within the managed workflow. The error relates to difficulties integrating native modules or platform-specific code into the Expo project. The exact nature of the error is not always clear due to a lack of detailed error messages. 

## Reproduction

The `expoBug.js` file contains example code that might trigger this type of error.  The cause could be an incompatible native module, improper configuration, or a conflict between Expo's managed workflow and the native code. 

## Solution

The `expoBugSolution.js` file offers potential solutions to resolve this issue.  These solutions might involve double-checking native module compatibility, adjusting the Expo configuration, or modifying the native code to meet Expo's requirements. Detailed steps are provided in the solution file.

## Additional Notes

This type of error often requires careful examination of the Expo documentation, native module documentation, and potentially debugging using native development tools (Android Studio or Xcode) if the managed workflow debugging tools prove insufficient.
