The solution to this type of uncommon Expo CLI error often requires a multi-pronged approach.  There's no single fix, but these steps can help:

1. **Verify Native Module Compatibility:** Ensure the native module you're using is compatible with the Expo version you're running. Consult the module's documentation for compatibility information and any Expo-specific instructions.
2. **Check Expo Configuration:**  Review your `app.json` or `expo.json` file for any settings related to native modules or platform-specific configurations that might be conflicting or incorrect. 
3. **Examine the Error Log:** Carefully analyze the full error log produced by the Expo CLI. Look for any clues, even seemingly minor details, that might point to the root cause.
4. **Simplify Your Code:** If you recently integrated a new native module or modified existing native code, attempt to temporarily revert those changes. This helps isolate the source of the problem.
5. **Use Expo's Debugging Tools:** Expo offers several tools for debugging, such as remote debugging and logging. Utilize these tools to gather more information and identify the exact point of failure.
6. **Consider Bare Workflow (Advanced):**  If the problem persists and you have significant native code integration needs, consider transitioning to Expo's bare workflow.  This gives you more control over native modules but requires more native development knowledge.
